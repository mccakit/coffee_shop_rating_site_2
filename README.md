This a coffee shop rating website I made to display my analytical skills, It's mostly done. Here are some of the features.
-Location and rating based search filtering(in seperate pages will combine if I learn a bit frontend)
-Authentication system with bcrypt encryption and salting
-Profile pages with a notification feed(in the making, static page is already made)
